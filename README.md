# Progress-Steps-Bar
Progress Steps Bar using HTML, CSS and JS 

This is a pretty simple project to demonstrate a progress steps bar using pure html, css and javascript. I has the following functions:
1. Prev/Next buttons are used to navigate through the steps.
2. Prev/Next buttons are being disabled when reaching their peak (prev is disabled at the 1st element, next at the last one).
3. The progress bar and the circles are being filled to represent which stage you're at.
4. Transition and Transformation effects are applied to enhance UX.
